/**
 * Describes a plan for performing a load of results.
 *
 * Generally speaking there are 3 forms of load plans:<ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.LoadPlan.Disposition#ENTITY_LOADER} - An entity load plan for
 *         handling get/load handling.  This form will typically have a single return (of type {@link org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.EntityReturn})
 *         defined by {@link #getReturns()}, possibly defining fetches.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.LoadPlan.Disposition#COLLECTION_INITIALIZER} - A collection initializer,
 *         used to load the contents of a collection.  This form will typically have a single return (of
 *         type {@link org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.CollectionReturn}) defined by {@link #getReturns()}, possibly defining fetches
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.LoadPlan.Disposition#MIXED} - A query load plan which can contain
 *         multiple returns of mixed type (though all implementing {@link org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.Return}).  Again, may possibly define fetches.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * todo : would also like to see "call back" style access for handling "subsequent actions" such as...<ul>
 *     <li>follow-on locking</li>
 *     <li>join fetch conversions to subselect fetches</li>
 * </ul>
