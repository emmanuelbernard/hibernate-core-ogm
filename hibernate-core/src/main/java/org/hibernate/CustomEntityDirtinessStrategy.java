 * During a flush cycle, Hibernate needs to determine which of the entities associated with a {@link Session}.
 * Dirty entities are the ones that get {@literal UPDATE}ed to the database.
 * <p/>
 * In some circumstances, that process of determining whether an entity is dirty can take a significant time as
 * by default Hibernate must check each of the entity's attribute values one-by-one.  Oftentimes applications
 * already have knowledge of an entity's dirtiness and using that information instead would be more performant.
 * The purpose of this contract then is to allow applications such a plug-in point.
