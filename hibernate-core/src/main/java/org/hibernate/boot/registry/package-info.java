/**
 * Defines service registry contracts application are likely to want to utilize for
 * configuring Hibernate behavior.
 *
 * Service registries are designed to be hierarchical.  This works in 2 fashions.  First registries can "hide" or
 * "override" services from parent registries.  It also allows granular building of registries as services
 * become available.
 *
 * {@link BootstrapServiceRegistry} is the base service registry, intended to be built via
 * {@link BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder} if you need customization.  For non-customized
 * {@link BootstrapServiceRegistry} usage, the {@link BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder} and
 * {@link BootstrapServiceRegistry} can be bypassed altogether.
 *
 * Usually the next level in a standard registry set up is the {@link StandardServiceRegistry}, intended to be built
 * by the {@link StandardServiceRegistryBuilder} if you need customization.  The builder optionally takes the
 * {@link BootstrapServiceRegistry} to use as a base; if none is provided a default one is generated assuming sensible
 * defaults in Java SE and EE environments, particularly in respect to Class loading.
